    <h1>Golfing in Utah County</h1>
    <h2>Cedar Hills Golf Course:</h2>
    <p>The Cedar Hills Golf Club is a 6,600 yard,18-hole, par 72 championship golf course nestled at the mouth of picturesque American Fork Canyon in North-Central Utah County. With the first tee shot dropping almost 200 feet from the tee to the fairway, an exciting round of golf is guaranteed right from the beginning. Far from the average hard-edged, manicured golf course, Cedar Hills lets nature do the talking. The unique lace-edged bunkers blend into the natural transition areas with native grasses creeping right into the bunkers. Our course layout encompasses varied topography and view vistas from the highest point on the 14th green, which is 5,253 feet above sea level, to the American Fork River 750 feet below.
